# HR-Data-Analytics-Tableau

The goal of this Tableau project on HR analytics is to give HR managers and corporate executives a thorough method to track, analyze, and make decisions about hiring, development, and retention of employees based on data.

HR managers can use the trendline and target line features to monitor their progress in lowering attrition. Charts displaying the employee distribution and attrition rate by age group, gender, work satisfaction, and educational field are included. HR managers can delve deeper and examine the data further with the help of interactive filters and legends on the chart.
